# Scripts and notebook for creating and analyzing spectrograms of gravitational waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers.

## Data taken from [CoRe](http://www.computational-relativity.org/)

## Producing spectrograms of postmerger phase and analyzing.

### The project contains the following files:
- `Download_extract.py`: script for downloading and organizing the data.
- `Plots.ipynb`: notebook that creates the spectrograms and analyzes them.
- `Plots.py`: script that creates the spectrograms and analyzes them.
- `tid_def/`: folder containing all the information about the EOS of the different binary neutron stars. The analysis was done using [pyTOVpp](https://github.com/johnkou97/pyTOVpp) 
- `results/`: folder containing all the different plots that were created using the scripts and notebooks
